  <h3>Work that has been completed</h3>

  <p> For the small task, I chose to create a still life animated page. The brief for this was "Your website (a single page) cannot be anything like the original products website (if there is
one) and the website can only sell this one item, it is not a standard ecommerce shop that sells
multiple items or products. You should design and create/take your own unique content
(Both text and images/photos) to sell the product. Using motion design in the site is optional
but advantageous for your portfolio". I chose to sell a lamp that was in my room. Within the page I included a description of the product, some buttons that did not go anywhere as only one page
was created, and a section for logging in or creating an account if they were to buy the product. Click on the small task link to see it.</p>

  <p> For the large task, I chose to do a redesign of a local business. The brief was "To help support struggling local (to yourself) small business during these hard times of covid.
Pick a local business that already has a website (max 5 pages*) and then analyse the site
identifying what you think are: </p>
<ul>
<li>(a) who are the users of the site?</li>
<li>(b) the goals of the site?</li>
<li>(c) what is wrong with the current site and potential problems?</li>
<li>(d) what are the potential solutions/ideas you have thought of?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you should redesign the website trying ensuring you address the issues identified in your
analysis. Then produce a short presentation showing the ”before and after” redesign of a local business." </p>
<p>I chose to redesign a local lettings agent website as I thought that there were some changes that needed to be made
which would improve the site overall. The users of the site were people who were looking for a place to rent which, in this town,
was mostly university students. There was also a section just for the landlords so that they wouldn't have to deal with finding
people to rent and the lettings agent would sort it for them so they would also be the users. The renting users would want to be able to find properties easily and contact the letting agents if they
wanted to book a viewing or sign a tenancy agreement. The landlord users would want to be able to have their properties listed and shown to possible renters. </p>
<p>Currently, the problems with the site are that there is quite a few unnecessary pages and some of the buttons do not stand out, also the colour scheme for the site is not that great. Some
potential solutions that I came up with was that instead of having small bits of information on unnecessary pages, I added them to other pages and used some JS to hide the information unless it was clicked on,
this allowed for more stuff to be placed on the website pages and got rid of some pages altogether. For example, there was a sign up page for the tenancy application which was 13 pages of stuff with the user having to
click next after each section of the agreement. I made so that it was all on the one page and the user could see how much they had to fill in. Another potential solution was that the buttons were changed to stand out
more so that the users would know what they were and could navigate through the site more easily. I also changed the background colour of the site from black to white as it would make all the text reading a lot easier. </p>
